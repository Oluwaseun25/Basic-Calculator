# Basic Calculator

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a basic calculator program that allows the user to perform mathematical operations on two numbers using basic functions and a dictionary to store the operations. The program should also have the ability to continue calculations with the result of previous calculations.

## Features
- Four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Dictionary to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions.
- Ability to continue calculations with the result of previous calculations.

## Instructions

### 1. Create Mathematical Functions
Define four basic mathematical functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function should take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the corresponding operation.

### 2. Create Operations Dictionary
Create a dictionary operations that maps operation symbols to their corresponding functions.

### 3. Create Calculator Function
Define a function calculator that prompts the user to input the first number and prints the available operation symbols.

### 4. Implement While Loop for Continuous Calculations
Use a while loop to continue calculations until the user chooses to end the current calculation.

### 5. Test the Program
Make sure to test the program with different inputs and operations to ensure that it is functioning properly.

## Notes
- Ensure proper handling of division by zero.
- Prompt the user clearly for input and display the results of calculations.
- Allow users to continue calculations with the result of previous operations or start a new calculation.
